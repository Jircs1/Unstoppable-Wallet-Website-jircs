# Blockchains Explained
Let’s explore how Bitcoin and other top-tier cryptocurrencies work. What makes them special, and how are they different from the traditional money in your bank account?

Bitcoin and leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum operate on blockchain technology. This technology enables millions of independent entities (phones, computers, servers, etc.) to transact securely in real-time without relying on a central authority.

Every blockchain is represented by publicly accessible software (a piece of code) that allows users to send transactions and track balances.

### Key Characteristics of Blockchain Technology
What makes blockchain a “special” technology? Here are its defining characteristics:

- #### 🌐 Distributed:
Instead of being stored in a centralized location, the blockchain's transaction history is held in thousands of locations simultaneously. Every participant maintains a copy, updated in near real-time.

- #### 🤝 Peer-to-Peer:
Any participant can add a new transaction to the global transaction history by communicating with any entity on the network. This information is then propagated to all other entities, ensuring 24/7 availability without a single point of failure.

- #### 🔍 Transparent:
Blockchains are generally transparent; the entire transaction history is public and accessible for scrutiny. While the transactions are visible, the identities of the parties involved remain anonymous.

- #### 🛡Immutable:
Once a transaction occurs, it cannot be reversed. This design ensures that the transaction history remains intact and unalterable.

- #### ⚖️ Democratic:
All network participants operate as equals, adhering to the same set of rules. Any attempts to act outside these agreed-upon rules are disregarded by the rest of the network.

### How Bitcoin Uses Blockchain
For instance, Bitcoin operates as a vast network of devices (computers, miners, etc.) running open-source Bitcoin software. These devices continuously communicate and maintain a record of Bitcoin transactions between network participants (i.e., wallets).

In essence, Bitcoin provides a financial platform for secure value exchange without relying on gatekeepers or intermediaries like banks.
