# CRYPTOCURRENCIES vs TOKENS

**Cryptocurrencies** are native units of account on a given blockchain. Each blockchain has its own base unit. Bitcoin (symbol '**BTC**') is the base unit of the Bitcoin blockchain, and Ether (symbol '**ETH**') is the base unit of the Ethereum blockchain.

### Smart Contracts

While the Bitcoin blockchain is mostly limited to BTC transfers from one address to another, the Ethereum allows for a wide variety of transactions beyond simple transfers of ETH between addresses.

Ethereum and many other newer blockchains enable people to create autonomous standalone programs operating on top of that blockchain. These programs are known as **smart contracts** and can be programmed by anyone.

There are thousands of various smart contracts running on top of Ethereum, created both by private individuals and business entities. These smart contracts can take arbitrary forms and can be anything from a lottery to a voting system to an exchange service.

### Tokens

In many cases, smart contracts can introduce their own unit of something. For example, consider a hypothetical lottery smart contract:

- This smart contract might create a **LOTTERY** token that can be used to enter a lottery draw.

- To obtain a LOTTERY token, a user must send a predefined payment to the smart contract.

- Any interaction with the lottery smart contract is recorded as a separate transaction on the blockchain.

Tokens can take many forms, and today, crypto tokens account for nearly 99% of all cryptocurrencies.

### Properties of Crypto Tokens

- #### üõ†Ô∏è Governance:
Tokens do not inherit the decentralization principles of base cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. Instead, they are governed by the smart contracts created by individuals, which can vary in design. For example, a creator might program a smart contract to allow a privileged user to create an unlimited number of tokens.

- #### üåê Multi-Blockchain Availability:
Token creators may launch their tokens on multiple blockchains. For instance, Tether‚Äôs USDT stablecoin exists on several different blockchains.

- #### üìè Design Standards:
Tokens usually adhere to specific design or engineering standards on the underlying blockchain. On Ethereum, tokens typically follow the ERC20 standard. This allows tokens to interact with other third-party smart contracts on the blockchain and be stored in cryptocurrency wallets.

- #### üí± Transactions:
Transferring a certain amount of a token from one wallet to another is a transaction on the blockchain and requires a fee paid in the base cryptocurrency of the underlying blockchain.
