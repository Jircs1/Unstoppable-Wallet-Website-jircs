# What Is Self Custody?

Once you have acquired Bitcoin, transferring it to a non-custodial wallet is the next crucial step for securing your assets. Leaving Bitcoin on an exchange leaves it vulnerable to risks such as exchange hacks, insolvency, and governmental restrictions. The best way to take full control over your Bitcoin is through self-custody.

**Self-custody**Â refers to holding your own private keys, meaning no intermediary controls your Bitcoin. This form of ownership offers unmatched sovereignty over your assets. Unlike traditional financial systems, where your funds can be frozen or seized, Bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet is censorship-resistant. No government or third party can freeze, confiscate, or debase your Bitcoin, giving you complete control over your wealth.
