# CRYPTOCURRENCIES vs TOKENS

Cryptocurrencies are native units of account on a given blockchain. Each blockchain has its own base unit. Bitcoin (symbol 'BTC') is the base unit of the Bitcoin blockchain, and Ether (symbol 'ETH') is the base unit of the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Smart Contracts

While the Bitcoin blockchain is mostly limited to BTC transfers from one address to another, the Ethereum allows for a wide variety of transactions beyond simple transfers of ETH between addresses.

Ethereum and many other newer blockchains enable people to create autonomous standalone programs operating on top of that blockchain. These programs are known as smart contracts and can be programmed by anyone.

There are thousands of various smart contracts running on top of Ethereum, created both by private individuals and business entities. These smart contracts can take arbitrary forms and can be anything from a lottery to a voting system to an exchange service.

#### Tokens

In many cases, smart contracts can introduce their own unit of something. Let’s explore some hypothetical lottery smart contract a bit further.

By design, this smart contract can have a LOTTERY unit token which can be used to enter a lottery draw. To obtain a LOTTERY token, a user must send a predefined payment to the smart contract. Any interaction with the lottery smart contract is a separate transaction on the blockchain.

So, tokens can take many forms. Today, crypto tokens make up nearly 99% of all cryptocurrencies.

Here are some properties of crypto tokens:

- Tokens do not inherit the decentralization principles of base cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. Tokens on the other hand are governed by smart contracts created by people and thus can take any form. For instance, a creator of a smart contract may program it to allow a privileged user to create an unlimited number of tokens.

- Token creators may launch their tokens on multiple blockchains. For instance, Tether’s USDT stablecoin token exists on many blockchains.

- Tokens usually adhere to specific design/engineering standards on the underlying blockchain. On Ethereum, tokens usually follow the ERC20 standard. As a result, tokens can interact with other third-party smart contracts on that blockchain and can also be stored in cryptocurrency wallets.

- Transferring some amount of a token from one wallet to another is a transaction on the blockchain and requires a fee in the base cryptocurrency of the underlying blockchain.
