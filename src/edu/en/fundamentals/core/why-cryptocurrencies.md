# WHY CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

To understand cryptocurrencies in a broad sense, we need to first understand Bitcoin and explore its foundational principles. Why did Bitcoin grow, and why are more and more people getting attracted to it?

1) In practical terms, owning Bitcoin provides the following direct advantages:

#### Easily Move Capital Globally
The ability to transfer capital across borders in a discreet manner.

#### Access Capital Anywhere
The ability to access capital from any location discreetly.

#### Transact Freely
The ability to transact with anyone without relying on intermediaries like banks or a money trasnmatter service.

#### Preserve & Grow Capital
The ability to save, preserve capital and escape inflation. Infact, the rising popularity of Bitcoin made it an effective instrument to multiply the capital by investing in the asset long term.

2) In a broader sense, Bitcoin is a type of money that has following characteristics:

#### Decentralized Control
Is not controlled by any single entity.

#### Fixed Supply
Cannot be printed or inflated by any entity.

#### Resilient
Cannot be censored or shut down.

The main reason that attracted some of its strongest proponents (long before it became hugely popular) lies in the idea of democratic access to an alternative financial system where there are no borders or gatekeepers.

Unlike the legacy financial system, which is highly regulated, anyone can freely access and participate in the Bitcoin network on equal terms.
