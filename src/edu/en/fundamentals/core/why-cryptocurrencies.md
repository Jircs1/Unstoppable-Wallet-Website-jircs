# WHY CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

To understand cryptocurrencies in a broad sense, we need to first understand Bitcoin and explore its foundational principles. Why did Bitcoin grow, and why are more and more people getting attracted to it?

### 1) In practical terms, owning Bitcoin provides the following direct advantages:

- #### 🌍 Easily Move Capital Globally
Transfer capital across borders discreetly.

- #### 📍 Access Capital Anywhere
Access your capital from any location without restrictions.

- #### 🤝 Transact Freely
Conduct transactions with anyone without relying on intermediaries like banks or money transfer services.

- #### 💰 Preserve & Grow Capital
Save and preserve your capital while escaping inflation. In fact, the rising popularity of Bitcoin has made it an effective tool for long-term capital growth.
### 2) Broader Characteristics of Bitcoin
   
In a broader sense, Bitcoin embodies a new type of money with the following characteristics:

- #### 🔗 Decentralized Control
Not controlled by any single entity.

- #### 📉 Fixed Supply
Cannot be printed or inflated by any entity.

- #### 🛡️ Resilient
Cannot be censored or shut down.

The main reason that attracted some of its strongest proponents (long before it became hugely popular) lies in the idea of democratic access to an alternative financial system where there are no borders or gatekeepers.

Unlike the legacy financial system, which is highly regulated, anyone can freely access and participate in the Bitcoin network on equal terms.
