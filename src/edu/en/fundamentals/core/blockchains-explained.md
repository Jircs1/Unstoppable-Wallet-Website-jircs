# BLOCKCHAINS EXPLAINED

Now, let’s explore how Bitcoin and other top-tier cryptocurrencies actually work. What exactly makes them special? How are they different from traditional money in your bank account?

Bitcoin and top-tier cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are powered by blockchain technology. Blockchain technology enables millions of independent entities (phones, computers, servers, etc.) to transact with each other in real-time securely without relying on a central authority.

Every blockchain is represented by a publicly open software program (a piece of code) that primarily provides means for its users to send transactions to each other and tracks users’ balances.

What makes blockchain a “special” technology are the following characteristics:

#### Distributed:

Instead of being held in one centralized location, the blockchain allows for the ‘history of transactions’ to be held in thousands of locations simultaneously. Every participant keeps a copy, which gets updated in close to real-time.

#### Peer-to-Peer:

Any participant can add a new transaction to the global ‘history of transactions’ by communicating with any entity on the network. It is then propagated to all other entities on that network. The lack of a “single point of access” ensures 24/7 availability and unconditional access to participation.

#### Transparent:

Blockchains are generally transparent, where the entire ‘history of transactions’ is public and accessible for anyone to scrutinize. While transactions are public, the entities involved are masked: any third party can see what’s taking place but can’t tell who exactly was involved.

#### Immutable:

Blockchains are engineered so that once a transaction has taken place, it is impossible to reverse it. This ensures that no entity can alter the history of transactions.

#### Democratic:

All network participants are equal and abide by the same set of rules. If one entity tries to do anything outside of the agreed set of rules, it will be disregarded by other network participants.


For instance, a blockchain like Bitcoin is essentially a large network of devices (computers, miners, etc.) running open-source Bitcoin software. These devices constantly communicate with each other and keep a record of Bitcoin transactions conducted between network participants (i.e., wallets).

In this regard, Bitcoin aims to deliver a financial platform for secure value exchange without relying on gatekeepers or intermediaries such as banks.
